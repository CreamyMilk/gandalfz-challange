Kinyuaâ€™s solution to *: Find all non negative integers a, b such that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) = sqrt(2009)* 

$$
\sqrt a + \sqrt b = \sqrt 2009 \tag{i}
$$

$$
2009 = 7 * 7 * 41  \therefore \sqrt 2009 = 7 \sqrt 41
$$

$$
\therefore \sqrt a + \sqrt b = 7\sqrt41 \tag{ii}
$$

For the posed question to hold  $\sqrt{a}$ and $\sqrt{b}$   are probably the surds of $\sqrt{41}$

$$
\therefore x\sqrt 41 + y\sqrt 41 = 7\sqrt 41 \tag{iii}
$$

In order to satisfy the above surd equation

$$
x + y = 7   \tag{iv}
$$

From equation (ii) & (iii) we can establish

$$
x\sqrt 41 = \sqrt a \space \space ,\space \space  y\sqrt 41 = \sqrt b 
$$

$$
{(x\sqrt 41)}^2 = {(\sqrt a )} ^ 2 \space,\space {(y\sqrt 41)}^2 = {(\sqrt b )} ^ 2    
$$

$$
\therefore a = 41{x} ^2   \space \space ,\space \space b= 41{y} ^2
$$

From equation ( iv ) we can deduce  that  $0 \geq x \leq 7$  and  $y = 7 -x$

Given the above constraints we can deduce the values of a and b by the following

| x | y   =  ( 7 - x ) | a = 41 (x ^ 2) | b = 41 (y ^ 2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 7 | 0 | 2009 |
| 1 | 6 | 41 | 1476 |
| 2 | 5 | 164 | 1025 |
| 3 | 4 | 369 | 656 |
| 4 | 3 | 656 | 369 |
| 5 | 2 | 1025 | 164 |
| 6 | 1 | 1476 | 41 |
| 7 | 0 | 2009 | 0 |

The solutions (a, b) of the given equation 

are ( a , b ) =    

- (0,2009)
- (41,1476)
- (164,1025
- (369,656)
- (656,369)
- (1025,164)
- (1476, 41)
- (2009,0)
